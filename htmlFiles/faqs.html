        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">Is Advicely online counselling Confidential & Secure?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                Advicely ensures that your information is kept highly confidential and secure and will not be shared
                with anyone. We ensure your privacy and all the information will be kept confidential with your
                therapist. You can express yourself freely with full trust and openness. We provide you the
                platform where you can be your own true self without any masks and fear of judgment.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">How do I sign up for a session? Do I need to chat with the expert
            themselves?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                You have to first log on to our website, which you can do by vising "Book Now" page. After that,
                there will an option to chat with the bot, where you would be asked questions about your age group and
                how we can help you. The bot would then match you to the most suitable expert, and a meet link will be
                shared
                post slot-booking via the chat bot. No chatting would be done with the expert directly prior meeting.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">I had booked the slot for today evening, but now I would not be able to
            attend,
            due to some work. Can it be postponed?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                At Advicely, we believe that the users should be accountable for themeselves, and if they are not
                available,
                they should inform at least 12 hours prior to the meeting, so that the slot could be booked by others.
                If the
                meeting is scheduled within 12 hours, not joining the meeting would be an option, as the expert would
                leave it
                automatically after 15 minutes waiting time. Eitherway irrespective of the time left, you can chat with
                the bot
                again to reschedule the meeting.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">Can we chat with the expert to have a chat-only session or joining meet is
            necessary?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                As of now, we wanted this freedom of method of communcation with the expert to rest with the user. An
                only-chat or audio-only session is not availablewith us, but only video calls, where the users and
                Experts
                have all the freedom by themselves - to keep their cameras off, or maybe mic, or use only chat feature
                of
                Google Meet. In this way, the combinations of audio-chat or video-chat can be used independently.

        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">Can I choose my therapist as per my own needs?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                We make this step easy for you and we choose the best therapist for you so that you don't deal with the
                unnecessary stress to find out the best for you. Everyone is a quality therapist and counsellor in the
                Advicely. We will assign the specialized therapist as per your situation. So, you don't need to worry
                about getting the best one for you, We assure you the quality service and counselling.

    <div class="qlist">
        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">I find it difficult to express my feelings in front of unknown
            people. How would I share my personal problems here then?
        </button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                Firstly, there is no need to worry about being judged, you need to keep in mind that you just have to
                consider the expert in front of you as a friend. And just vent out your situations; our team has had
                a lot of experience in reading minds and they would be able to diagnose or get to know your feelings
                even if you are not able to communicate clearly.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">How do I decide when I need help in form of counselling?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                We face many situations in life, which sometimes become the reason of a major part of our worries.
                Some people do have close friends and family to discus what's bothering them. But in many of these
                cases too, they believe that they can't share their feelings with their known ones. If that's the
                case for you, Advicelywould be the best option, as you can share your thoughts with unknown people
                more freely and comfortably.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">I have finally decided to connect with experts but I still doubt
            sometimes will it actually work?
        </button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                There is no need at all to worry about whether you will get the desired results or not. Following the
                "Try and then trust" theory, we suggest you to sign up for your first session at a comparitively
                lesser price than the actual, and if it works for you, you may opt for other sessions as well. For this
                the bot would present an option to continue with same expert or not, and also allow to book the next
                slot,
                without the entire chat bot session.

        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">I don't think I learn anything in college. What if I don't get a
            job?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                Firstly, reflect and analyse if the course that you have chosen is of your choice and it is helping you
                to utilise your aptitude and skills to the maximum. If the answer to this is a “ yes”, then you are on
                the right track and you may dump your worries about securing a job. If your answer is a “ no”, do seek
                the help of a professional or seniors to match your course of study with your aptitude and skills.

        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">I am unable to talk in front of people. I feel stuck and shy. What are the
            ways in which I can improve?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                Try starting slow and with yourself so as to increase your confidence. Do a mirror technique. Prepare a 
                small piece of presentation and present it to yourself in front of the mirror and observe yourself. You 
                can also take up a topic and talk to yourself about it in front of the mirror. Now try and explain the 
                same thing to that friend as if you were presenting. Ask your friend to make notes as and when required on things to improve on it.
            </p>

        <button class="collapsible col-md-8">My boyfriend/girlfriend is moving to a different city. Does long-distance relationship work?</button>
        <div class="answers col-md-8">
            <p>
                One of the main components of successful relationships is proximity, regular communication and healthy 
                conflict resolution. According to my view, conflict resolution is more important than others in long 
                distance relations. We can maintain communication through social media. And in most cases this keeps 
                the spark alive. Do not discuss problems over the phone too much, as this would lead to poor conflict 
                resolution. Try to avoid any heated arguments on phone. Consider talking to each other as stress-reliever.
